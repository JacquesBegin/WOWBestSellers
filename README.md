# WOWBestSellers

World of Warcraft has many features that are enticing and keep players engaged for hours at a time. One of those features is the auction house. Here, players can buy and sell goods to improve their gaming experience by; enhancing their characters gear, acquiring trade goods to level professions, or selling any number of items for in game profit.

A feature missing from the auction house experience is the ability to see what items have been selling the best (both for profitability and quantity). This project will address those areas and allow users to input their server of interest and receiver output for which goods are selling the best.
